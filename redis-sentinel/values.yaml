    #### Connectio Management ####
    # Disable protected mode. DANGEROUS on a public interface.
    # Only use this when Redis is bound to private networks and/or ACL+AUTH is enforced.
    protected-mode no
    
    # Maximum number of client connections. Requires matching OS fd/ulimit tuning.
    # Very high values also require sufficient memory for client state.
    maxclients 50000
    
    # Listen backlog for pending TCP connection (subject to /proc/sys/net/core/somaxconn).
    tcp-backlog 65535

    timeout 0
    
    # TCP keepalive interval in seconds. Helps detect dead peers/NAT drops.

    #### Announce IP/Port (for replicas behind NAT) ####
    # use these when the master must connect back to a  replica that is not directly reachable.
    #sentinel announce-ip 192.168.0.100
    #sentinel announce-port 30012
    
    #### Memory Usage & Eviction ####
    # Hard cap for Redis memory. Includes data + overhead + client buffers.
    maxmemory 1gb
    
    # Evict any key (volatile or not) using LRU when memory is full.
    maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru
    
    # Number of samples checked by LRU/LFU/TTL algorithms (higher = better accuracy, more CPU).
    maxmemory-samples 10
    
    #### Performance / Timing ####
    # Server cron frequency (1..500). Higher reduces latency of periodic tasks but increases CPU.
    hz 100
    
    # Dynamically scale internal frequency based on load (uses 'hz' as the upper bound).
    # Redis 8 defaults to 'yes'. Uncommect to be explicit.
    dynamic-hz yes
    
    #### Latency tuning & Slow Log ####
    # Record operations taking >= 5 ms for analysis with LATENCY commands.
    latency-monitor-threshold 5
    
    # Log commands slower than 15 ms to the slowlog.
    slowlog-log-slower-than 15000
    # ...keeping up to 1024 entries (oldest evicted).
    slowlog-max-len 1024

    # Fsync AOF once per second (balance durability and throughput; up to ~1s data loss on crash).
    appendfsync everysec
    
    # Start AOF with an RDB preamble for faster restarts.
    aof-use-rdb-preamble yes

    #### Client Output Buffer limits ####
    # Format: <class> <hard> <soft> <soft-seconds>

    # Pub/Sub clients: tighter limits to prevent fan-out blowups.

    #### Replication robustness ####
    # Ring buffer for partial resync (PSYNC). Larger values tolerate longer outages.

    # Keep backlog this many seconds after the last replica disconnects.
    repl-backlog-ttl 3600

    # Master pings replicas every N seconds (keepalive + lag measurement).
    repl-ping-replica-period 10
    
    # Send snapshot directly over the socket (no on-disk temp file) for full syncs.
    repl-diskless-sync yes
    
    # When diskless, wait N seconds to gather more replicas before starting bulk transfer.
    repl-diskless-sync-delay 5
    
    #### Memory optimization for small Hashes ####
    # NOTE (Redis >= 7): "hash-max-ziplist-*" are legacy aliases for listpack thresholds.
    # Prefer "hash-max-listpack-*" in new configs; these aliases still work in Redis 8.
    # Use compact encoding for hashes with <= 1024 fields...
    hash-max-ziplist-entries 1024
    
    # and when each field+value is <= 256 bytes. Larger hashes are promoted to hashtable.
    hash-max-ziplist-value 256
    
    #### Asynchronous freeing & defragmentation ####
    # Evict keys lazily in background threads (reduces main-thread pauses during eviction).
    lazyfree-lazy-eviction yes
    
    # Free expired keys asynchronously instead of during the expiry path.
    lazyfree-lazy-expire yes
    
    # Perform DEL for complex objects in background threads (non-blocking deletes).
    lazyfree-lazy-server-del yes
    
    # Actively defragment memory to combat long-running fragmentation and stabilize RSS.
    activedefrag yes
    
    #### I/O Multi-Threading ####
    # Offload read handling to I/O threads (writes remain serialized on the main thread).
    io-threads-do-reads no
    
    # Number of I/O threads. Use a value close to available CPU cores; too high can hurt performance.
